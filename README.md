# Data Analyst Job Market Insights  
##  Overview  
This project was created to **showcase my proficiency in Python** while analyzing the **data job market**, with a strong focus on **data analyst roles**.  
The motivation behind this analysis is to gain clarity on which skills matter most for landing optimal opportunities, both in terms of **demand** and **salary potential**.  

##### Using job data sourced by  **Luke Barousse**, I examine job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills.  
##### Through Python-based analysis, I aim to answer key questions about the evolving data job landscape.

## Data Preparation and Cleanup
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

### Import & Clean Up Data
I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality, to focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

# The Analysis  

## 1. Most Demanded Skills for Top 3 Roles  
I identified the three most common job titles, then extracted the top five skills for each.  
This shows which skills are most valuable depending on the role.

###  Insights  

- **SQL** is the top skill for Data Analysts and Data Scientists, appearing in over half of job postings.  
- **Python** dominates for Data Engineers (68%) and is also highly valued for Data Scientists (72%) and Data Engineers (65%).  
- Data Engineers often need specialized tools (**AWS, Azure, Spark**), while Analysts and Scientists rely more on general tools like **Excel** and **Tableau**.
    
## 2. Trending Skills for Data Analysts  

To track 2023 trends, I filtered **Data Analyst** roles and grouped skills by posting month.  
This revealed the **top five skills per month**, showing how their demand shifted over the year.

### insights

- SQL remains the top skill but declines about 10 percentage points (â‰ˆ64% â†’ â‰ˆ54%).
- Excel falls mid-year then rebounds, peaking â‰ˆ45% in Jul/Aug and finishing near â‰ˆ40%.
- Python and Tableau are stable around 30â€“35%, with Tableau rising late to â‰ˆ33%.
- Power BI is lowest (â‰ˆ18â€“23%) but shows a small year-end uptick.

### Takeaway 
**Data analysts should focus on mastering SQL and Python, supplemented with Excel; add Tableau for visualization and can treat Power BI as optional.**

## Final Insights
- **Shifting market:** Skill demand changes over time â€” staying current is essential for career growth.  
- **Prioritization:** Learn skills that are both in high demand and well-compensated to maximize economic return.

  ## what I learned
- **advanced python:** stronger skills with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for cleaning and visuals.  
- **data prep matters:** accurate cleaning and formatting are essential for reliable results.  
- **storytelling with notebooks:** clear narrative + visuals improves reproducibility and reviewer understanding.  
- **version control:** using git/GitHub for tracking changes and sharing work.  
- **market fit:** how to match learning priorities to demand and salary potential.

## Conclusion  
Working on this project taught me a lot about the data analyst job market and the skills that matter most.  
I faced challenges with cleaning and organizing data, but they helped me get better at problem-solving and visualization.  
The insights I gained give me clearer direction for growing in data analytics and staying adaptable as the field changes.
